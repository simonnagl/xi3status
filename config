# This is a default config file for xi3status
# 
# It is designed to use as many options as possible,
# not to be a perfect configuration file.
# This is because there is no perfect file.
# 
# Basic syntax description (for details look at the manpage)
#
# Lines starting with # are comments.
# There are two types of elements parsed.
# 1. Group names in squared brackets: E.g. [Time]
# 2. Key Value pairs: E.g. key=value
#
# A new group begins a new block.
# Only the group [Global] is used for global
# configuration issues
